This repository contains my practice of advanced C++ programming.

The exercises focus on:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- STL (Standard Template Library)
- Templates and Generic Programming
- Boost Libraries
- And more...

This repo serves as:
- A record of my progress in mastering modern C++.
- A portfolio for future employers to assess my coding style and depth in C++.
